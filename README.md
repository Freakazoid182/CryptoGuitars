# CryptoGuitars NFT

__NOTE: This project will get renamed after rebranding__

The purpose of this project is to get some hands on experience with Blazor, using the MudBlazor components library and MetaMask.Blazor.

There's not incentive to make money on the NFTs whatsoever. It will probably never be hosted on a production blockchain.
